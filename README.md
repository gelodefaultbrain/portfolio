- Web based Ordering System from a client‚Äôs small
restaurant  

  This web app was for my Database and Web Programming subject in college. I am proud to say that this was made from scratch and no bootstrap or any other third party
  software was used. ü§Ø

*Freelancer*

- GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool that scrapes products from [ebay.com.au](https://www.ebay.com.au/)  

  This tool scrapes data from ``ebay.com.au`` search results. My client wanted to scrape data based from a query. To be more specific he wanted to scrape Watches ‚åöüòÖ
  I was just a beginner during this moment so this project was a stepping stone for me to improve my web scrapers and applications.

- Web Scraping bots to scrape data from websites (e.g.,
airbnb.com, aliexpress.com and ebay.com)  



<strong style='font-size: 50px;'>2020</strong>  
*Software Developer*

- Application program to generate (Anki) apkg files
using Google Docs (via Google Docs API) and send via
email  

  Application name: **Anki Express**

  Personally before working with other companies after Speakda. I'd say this was the most stressing but at the same time **BEST** software that I have ever built. In all honesty, I had no idea how to even do this from the start. I had no idea with Anki and even with Google Docs API. But that's where the determination and patience kicks in. For some reason I was able to do it, I studied all the components necessary for this software to work (especially how Anki was designed programmatically) (I had to learn it's software architecture in order to generate and copy its features to create our own product). I am very proud of this, I'd say a **TOP 1** of my highlights.
  
  A small example on how it works would be that the user would input something like this via Google Docs.

  and the program would generate an output similar to this one.

  A more structured and detailed inputs would be like:

  The ``.apkg`` file would then be sent to the client/user via email.

- Application program to extract and read (Anki) apkg
files data to perform data analysis and import the
results programmatically to Google Spreadsheet (via
Google Sheets API)  

  Application name: **Mass Anki Deck Analyzer**
  
  This one also was one of the most intense project's I've created. I had to learn the programming architecture of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) in order for this project to be successful.
  
  An example **output** of the program would be like this in a Google Sheet thanks to the [Google Sheet API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts#:~:text=The%20Google%20Sheets%20API%20is,Update%20spreadsheet%20formatting).

  The python application is deployed as a cronjob in a server.

- Desktop Application tool that analyzes large XML data
and performs Google Translation via Google
Translation API  

  Application name: **2000 Sentences Selector Tool**
  
  I had a very fun time building this project. I would say it was the most fun I had. Learning more about the [PyQT](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) framework to build GUI Application tools. It was absolutely amazing and I am very much proud of this as well.

  This was the part that [Google Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) was implemented. To translate sentences from based from different languages.

*Scraper Developer*  


- Python web crawler applications, deployed as
cronjobs to keep track of the latest trends of ecommerce products  

  I enjoyed creating these web crawlers during my time here. It was very challenging. Bypassing the captchas and other security features by the websites being scraped. I had to implement different techniques (proxy rotation, cookies, retries) to achieve the tasks. I learned a lot and very much thankful for this.

  Python applications deployed as cronjobs. Will run on the time set.
